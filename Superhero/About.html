            <p>Wonder Woman, also known as Diana Prince, is an Amazonian Princess from the paradise Island of Themyscira, a secluded island located off the coast of the real world. Born from the soil of the island and given life and form by the Greek gods, she was raised by her mother, Queen Hippolyta, and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe. The direct intervention of the gods Athena and Aphrodite in her creation granted Diana superhuman powers.</p>
            <p>Trained from a young age in a wide range of martial arts and educated in the sciences and humanities, Diana becomes an ambassador to the outside world. She leaves Themyscira on a mission of peace, but also ready for battle when the call to justice needs her.</p>
            <p>Since her creation in 1941 by psychologist William Moulton Marston, Wonder Woman has been a symbol of strength, truth, peace, and equality to people everywhere.</p>
